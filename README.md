and assignment 1 by the club which was also submitted way past deadline
I had no clue how to upload files on github ( my friend used to do that for me) , I was learning css and had a very little knowledge of javascript. In the process of this project 
i learnt most of the things


Stage 1:
i collected all the tools i had and tried my best to make whatever i could.
During my summer vacation I got very interested by web develpment and bought a course on udemy to learn it....i am around 1/3rd way through where iwas taught ,mostly html and css
the first iterations were very bad looking websites...I tried to use figma to make websites...though i had no idea how figma works and made the first design using pen and paper

stage 2: thanks to youtube and google and following websites which helped me a lot to make this website
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
https://www.w3schools.com/
https://getbootstrap.com/
https://tailblocks.cc/
https://wickedblocks.dev/

stage 3:
I took the current dev club website as an inspiration and tried to create my own version of it
the website took me around 7 days to make...however 1/3rd of my time was spent on learning git and figma


I started by making the main home page
then i made different pages corresponding to my need
as i dont know react and could not learn it in the given time, i tried to make navigation mostly using anchor tags
every page was designed by hand initially, then i tried making figma of few pages. Honestly i got the feel of hand drawn pages lot better hence ditched figma after making a couple of pages
figma file link :

after lot of trial and error i made the main page followed ny other pages
I tried making the website as interactive as possible
i added hover effects so that the feel of website is good
i tried animations use css/js on the main page
I used bootstrap and tailblocks as they gave the "flex" results pretty good or the responsiveness of website was made good by them
after all the layouts i added links to all the buttons 
I tried to customize website as much as possiblel using html and css...i tried to add few amaizng effects like

in the given time I gave my best with whatever i could make...I really really want to be a part of this club!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
thanku
